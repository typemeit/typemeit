# type me it

Hold the fn key, speak, let go. The speech is transcribed on this Mac by Parakeet through transcribe.cpp, tidied up by Apple Intelligence, and typed wherever the cursor is. It learns your vocabulary from the corrections you make afterwards, keeps a text-only history, and shows usage insights. Nothing leaves the computer.

macOS 26 or newer, Apple silicon.

## Build

```
brew install xcodegen
DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=Z28DW76Y3W xcodegen generate
```

Debug builds are a separate app, `type me it dev` with bundle id
`it.typeme.typemeit.dev`, signed with the Developer ID certificate. It runs
beside the installed release with its own settings, and because the signature
is stable across rebuilds, macOS keeps its Input Monitoring and Microphone
grants: they are asked for once, not after every build. Without that
certificate in the keychain, drop the `Debug` block under `configs` in
`project.yml` before generating.

```sh
xcodebuild -project typemeit.xcodeproj -scheme typemeit -configuration Debug build
xcodebuild -project typemeit.xcodeproj -scheme typemeit test
```

Dependencies are the transcribe.cpp XCFramework, fetched by SwiftPM from the upstream release (`Packages/TranscribeCpp`), and Sparkle, which handles updates. The speech model (697 MB) is downloaded during onboarding into `~/Library/Application Support/typemeit/models/`.

## Permissions

Microphone, Accessibility (pasting and reading corrections) and Input Monitoring (the fn key). Grants are keyed to the code signature, so run a Developer ID signed build from `/Applications` or expect to re-grant after each rebuild.

## Layout

- `typemeit/` app sources, one file per module
- `typemeit/Learning/`, `typemeit/Insights/` ports of Handy's learning engine and insights, with their tests in `typemeitTests/`
- `Packages/TranscribeCpp/` the XCFramework wrapper
- `web/` the puff on a web page, driven by the pointer; `generate.py` transpiles the shader from `typemeit/Overlay/Puff.metal`
- `Scripts/`, `.github/workflows/` the release pipeline; `Scripts/generate-dmg-background.sh` draws the disk image's background from frames of the app's own puff shader in `Scripts/puff/`; `Scripts/generate-og.sh` draws the site's link previews, `web/og.png` and `web/og-square.png`, the same way through `Scripts/og/`
