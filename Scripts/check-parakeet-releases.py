"""Check whether a newer parakeet speech model exists than the one we ship.

Two things can go stale, and each is checked against what the app actually
pins rather than against a state file, so there is nothing to keep in sync:

  1. The GGUF we download has been rebuilt -- a requantisation, or a rebuild
     against a newer base. Checked by hashing, not by revision: the repo's head
     moves for README edits too, and those are not our problem.
  2. NVIDIA has published a parakeet model newer than the base model our GGUF
     was quantised from, which is how a whole new generation shows up.

Findings go to stdout and, under Actions, to $GITHUB_OUTPUT as `has_findings`,
`digest` (stable per set of findings, so the workflow only notifies once),
`title`, `message` and `link`.
